# SixWordStory

A little demo app to go from a basic layout for our 'about me' app to more complex elements, based on our Teaching Develop in Swift class.

This `main` branch shows off the most basic approach to my six word story from the March 2021 Teaching Develop in Swift class.

Check out other branches for more sophisticated touches we can add to our prototype.
